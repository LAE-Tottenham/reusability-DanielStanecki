# Help! I'm trying to make this cool bot but my code is too messy :( Please help me organise it into reusable components.

# Define your reusable functions here:

# Make sure each function only does ONE thing!!!!!!!!!!!

# After you have written the reusable functions, answer the following:
# Questions:
# 1. What are the preconditions for your code not to break?
    
    #one precondition is that the name needs to be valid, otherwise the code will return that the "probability of being a None is 0.0%"

# 2. Validate the user's input based on your preconditions.

# 3. Why was it useful to use reusable components in this case? Please mention at least 2 reasons and don't forget to contextualise.
    # one reason it was useful to use reusable components is because this particular code is relatively complicated, so the reusable components
    # simplify the code and make it easier to understand and read. 
    # another reason that it was useful to use reusable components is because it makes it easier to make adjustments to the code instead of having
    # to rewrite an entire section of code multiple times.

# Further Tasks:
# 1. Put your functions in seperate appropriate files and import them in.

# 2. Make sure all of your functions (except the main one) only do ONE thing or process.

# 3. Add your own twist to the code.
    #added an extra line if the user answers "yes" to if they want a cat fact.


# Extension:
# Add the following apis as reusable components and use them in your code:
